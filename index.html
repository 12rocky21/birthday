          <br>
          Just a pick-up line that i
          thought...."I THINK OF YOU WHEN I READ 1 CORINTHIANS - 13"....Let me
          know how's it :) 
          <br>
          <br>
          <hr>
          1 CORINTHIANS - 13:4-8 4 Love is patient, love is
          kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does
          not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered,
          it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but
          rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always
          hopes, always perseveres.8 Love never fails. But where there are
          prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be
          stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 
          <hr>
          Hope someday
          we'll be able to love each other just like how Paul describes in 1
          Corinthians - 13, will try my best to do so, one more thing to say
          sorry about , I am SORRY about my possessive nature sometimes, it can
          be a good thing as well, but over possesiveness is also not that good,
          so thank you for handling my possesiveness, I do TRUST you the MOST
          even though it might not be that easy to show it out but yeah so THANK
          you being there for me 
          <br>
          <br>
          HAPPY BIRTHDAY AGAIN MY BABY PRINCESS GIRL
